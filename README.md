# Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction
I have build the machine learning system to predict big mart sales.

## Problem Statement 
The grocery store wants us to predict the sales which they can expect.

## Benefits of Predicting the Sales
* Predict Sales Revenue
* Preceive Challenges Early
* Motivate Sales Team
* Plan Recruitment Strategy
* Aid Future Marketing Plans

## About the project
This particular project is Regression based machine learning project because we are predicting the sales as it is a countinuous value. Regression is about predicting a quantity and 
continuous values. Eg: Salary, age, price.

Machine Learning is classified into Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning. In Supervised learning we train our model with labeled dataset whereas in Unsupervised learning we train
the model with unlabeled dataset. In this project the labels are the target.

Supervised learning is classified into two types:-

* Classification
* Regression

## Workflow
### 1. Data
For this project we are going to use big mart sales data. 

### 2. Data Pre-Processing
We will be encoding the categorical features and other things.

### 3. Data Analysis
We will be analyzing the data it's called the Exploratory Data Analysis where we put the data in some suitable plots and graph and see what are the distribution of various data points
and what is the count of various features. So this data analysis helps us to find the meaing the data has to tell.

### 4. Train Test Split
In these we will split our dataset into training data and testing data. So what happens in machine learing we train our machine learing model with training data and we test or evaluate with 
the test data.

### 5. XGBoost Regressor
After splitting the original data into training data and testing data we will feed this to our machine learing model. In this project we are going to use regression model called as XGBoost
Regressor.

### 6. Evaluate
After we train this regressor with our training data we will evaluate it based on the test data so this step is called Evaluation.
